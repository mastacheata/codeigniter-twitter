CodeIgniter-Twitter
=============

A complete library giving you twitter oauth authentication and api access.
The library consists of 2 parts. 
An OAuth Library that uses the OAuth.php Library from http://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/code/php/, but is API compatible to the PECL::OAuth Library.
The second part is the Twitter API itself that is the specific implementation of Twitter's OAuth 1.0a.
